# UploadThing Migration & Fix Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to resolve UploadThing upload errors and restore full document logic across the application.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed UploadThing Route Configuration
- **File**: `app/api/uploadthing/route.ts`
- Consolidated route handlers into a single file
- Added middleware to provide metadata
- Modified `onUploadComplete` to return structured data
- Exported route handlers directly for Next.js App Router

### 2. Enhanced Upload Components

#### MasterSheetUpload.js
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Implemented response validation
- Added success notifications
- Integrated with Turso database for metadata storage

#### DocumentsUpload.js
- Added file tracking for uploaded documents
- Implemented batch processing for multiple files
- Added visual feedback with file chips
- Proper error handling for failed uploads

### 3. Database Schema Updates
Added new tables:
- `master_sheets`: Dedicated table for master sheet metadata
- `validation_history`: Track validation runs over time

### 4. New Helper Functions
**File**: `lib/db-helpers.js`
- `saveMasterSheetToTurso()`: Save master sheet metadata
- `saveDocumentToTurso()`: Save document metadata
- `formatFileSize()`: Human-readable file sizes
- `formatUploadDate()`: Formatted dates

### 5. New Components

#### ValidationHistory.js
- Displays past validation runs
- Shows pass/fail statistics
- Allows viewing detailed results

#### DocumentsList.js
- Lists uploaded documents and master sheets
- Download functionality
- Delete functionality
- File metadata display

### 6. API Endpoints Created
- `/api/documents/save-master-sheet`: Save master sheet metadata
- `/api/documents/list/[dealId]`: List documents for a deal
- `/api/documents/master-sheets/[dealId]`: List master sheets
- `/api/validations/history/[dealId]`: Get validation history

## Usage

### Uploading Files
1. Files are uploaded via UploadThing
2. Response is parsed to extract: fileName, fileSize, fileUrl, fileType
3. Metadata is saved to Turso database
4. UI updates to show uploaded files

### Viewing Documents
- Documents are displayed in the DocumentsList component
- Files can be downloaded or deleted
- Metadata shows file size and upload date

### Validation History
- Past validation runs are tracked in the database
- History shows summary statistics
- Details can be viewed for each run

## Error Handling
- UploadThing responses are validated before processing
- Null/undefined checks prevent crashes
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual validation logic
2. Add validation run functionality
3. Create detailed validation results view
4. Add bulk operations for documents
